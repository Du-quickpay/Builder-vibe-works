# ‚úÖ TimeoutError: signal timed out - FIXED

## Problem Summary

**Error**: `TimeoutError: signal timed out`

This error was occurring because our network requests were using overly aggressive timeout values, causing requests to fail before they could complete in slower network conditions.

## Root Cause

The system was using very short timeouts:

- **Network diagnostics**: 3-5 seconds
- **Quick connectivity checks**: 2 seconds
- **Smart fetch**: 15 seconds
- **Polling requests**: 35 seconds

These timeouts were too aggressive for:

- Slower network connections
- High-latency environments
- Cloudflare Worker cold starts
- Network congestion

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Increased All Timeout Values**

**Network Diagnostics**:

```typescript
// Before: 5 seconds
timeout: number = 5000;

// After: 15 seconds
timeout: number = 15000;
```

**Quick Connectivity Check**:

```typescript
// Before: 2 seconds
signal: AbortSignal.timeout(2000);

// After: 8 seconds
signal: AbortSignal.timeout(8000);
```

**Smart Fetch**:

```typescript
// Before: 15 seconds
signal: AbortSignal.timeout(15000);

// After: 30 seconds
signal: AbortSignal.timeout(30000);
```

**Polling Requests**:

```typescript
// Before: 35 seconds
signal: AbortSignal.timeout(35000);

// After: 45 seconds
signal: AbortSignal.timeout(45000);
```

### 2. **Enhanced Timeout Error Handling**

**Before**:

```typescript
if (error.name === "AbortError" || error.message?.includes("timeout")) {
  this.currentPollDelay = Math.min(10000, this.currentPollDelay * 1.2);
}
```

**After**:

```typescript
if (
  error.name === "AbortError" ||
  error.name === "TimeoutError" ||
  error.message?.includes("timeout") ||
  error.message?.includes("timed out")
) {
  console.log("‚è∞ Request timed out, adjusting timeout and delay...");
  this.currentPollDelay = Math.min(15000, this.currentPollDelay * 1.5);
}
```

### 3. **Progressive Timeout Strategy**

The system now uses a tiered approach:

1. **Quick Tests**: 8 seconds (for basic connectivity)
2. **Diagnostics**: 15 seconds (for thorough testing)
3. **API Calls**: 30 seconds (for Telegram API requests)
4. **Long Polling**: 45 seconds (for update polling)

## Files Modified

### Updated Files:

- üìù `src/lib/network-connectivity-fix-resilient.ts` - Increased all timeout values
- üìù `src/lib/telegram-callback-service-enhanced.ts` - Enhanced timeout handling

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. **Better Network Tolerance**

- Works with slower internet connections
- Handles high-latency environments
- Tolerates network congestion
- Accommodates Cloudflare Worker cold starts

### 2. **Smarter Error Recovery**

- Recognizes both `AbortError` and `TimeoutError`
- Increases delays more aggressively when timeouts occur
- Better exponential backoff strategy

### 3. **Reduced Error Frequency**

- Fewer false timeout errors
- More successful network requests
- Better user experience in poor network conditions

## Expected Behavior Now

### 1. **No More Premature Timeouts**

Requests that previously failed with timeout errors should now complete successfully in most network conditions.

### 2. **Graceful Timeout Handling**

When timeouts do occur (in very poor network conditions), the system:

- Logs clear timeout messages
- Increases retry delays more aggressively
- Continues to attempt recovery
- Doesn't crash or stop trying

### 3. **Better Performance in Various Conditions**

- **Good Networks**: Still fast and responsive
- **Slow Networks**: Now works instead of timing out
- **Poor Networks**: Graceful degradation with retries
- **Intermittent Networks**: Better recovery mechanisms

## Testing the Fix

### 1. **Check Console Logs**

Should see fewer timeout errors and more successful requests:

```
‚úÖ Connection test passed
‚úÖ Request successful to: https://telegram-proxy...
üì° Received X updates
```

### 2. **Network Conditions**

The system should now work in:

- Slow mobile networks
- High-latency connections
- Congested networks
- Geographic locations far from servers

### 3. **Debug Tools**

Visit `/debug` and run network tests - they should complete without timeout errors.

## Timeout Values Summary

| Request Type | Before | After | Reason                                   |
| ------------ | ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Quick Check  | 2s     | 8s    | Basic connectivity should be reliable    |
| Diagnostics  | 5s     | 15s   | Thorough testing needs more time         |
| API Calls    | 15s    | 30s   | Telegram API can be slow                 |
| Long Polling | 35s    | 45s   | Polling needs extra time for reliability |

**The TimeoutError is now fixed! üéâ**

The system now uses reasonable timeout values that work across different network conditions while maintaining good performance.
