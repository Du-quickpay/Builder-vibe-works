# Console Errors and Performance Fixes

This document outlines all the fixes implemented to resolve console errors and improve system performance.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. WebSocket Connection Failures ✅

**Problem**: `WebSocket connection to 'wss://...' failed`
**Cause**: Vite dev server WebSocket configuration issues
**Solution**:

- Updated `vite.config.ts` with proper HMR configuration
- Added CORS settings and optimized dev server settings
- Dev server now runs on port 8081 with proper WebSocket support

### 2. Font Loading 404 Errors ✅

**Problem**: Iran Sans fonts returning 404 from jsdelivr CDN

```
GET https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rastikerdar/iran-sans@v5.0.0/dist/IRANSans.woff2 404 (Not Found)
```

**Cause**: Incorrect CDN path structure
**Solution**:

- Updated font URLs in `src/index.css` to use correct webfonts directory
- Added fallback fonts for resilience
- Changed from `/dist/` to `/dist/webfonts/` path

### 3. Telegram Rate Limiting (429 Errors) ✅

**Problem**: Excessive 429 errors with retry delays up to 300+ seconds

```
POST .../editMessageText 429 (Too Many Requests)
⏱️ Rate limited (429), retry after 300s
```

**Cause**: Real-time tracker sending too many status updates
**Solution**:

- Implemented comprehensive rate limiting in `enhanced-realtime-tracker.ts`
- Added debouncing (1-3 seconds) for all event handlers
- Reduced heartbeat frequency from 3s to 10s
- Added max 6 status changes per minute limit
- Added 5-second minimum interval between status changes
- Implemented status change history tracking

### 4. React Prop Warnings ✅

**Problem**: Invalid DOM attributes passed to React elements

```
Warning: React does not recognize the `fetchPriority` prop on a DOM element
Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `jsx`
```

**Solution**:

- Fixed `fetchPriority` → `fetchpriority` (lowercase) in LoginForm
- Removed `jsx` prop from `<style jsx>` → `<style>` in all components
- Created `react-fixes.ts` utility for future prop handling

### 5. Module Import/Export Error ✅

**Problem**: Default export not found

```
SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/lib/enhanced-realtime-tracker.ts' does not provide an export named 'default'
```

**Solution**:

- Added both named and default exports for `enhancedRealtimeTracker`
- Exported `UserPresenceState` and `UserPresenceCallback` interfaces
- Ensured compatibility with existing import statements

### 6. React Router Future Warnings ⚠️

**Problem**: Future compatibility warnings

```
⚠️ React Router Future Flag Warning: React Router will begin wrapping state updates in `React.startTransition` in v7
```

**Status**: Non-critical warnings about future React Router versions

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Reduced API Call Frequency

- **Before**: Status updates every 3 seconds + on every window focus/blur
- **After**:
  - Heartbeat every 10 seconds (only when active)
  - Debounced event handlers (1-3 seconds)
  - Rate limiting with max 6 changes per minute
  - Throttling for rapid state changes

### 2. Memory Leak Prevention

- Added cleanup utilities in `react-fixes.ts`
- Proper event listener removal in tracker
- Automatic cleanup on page unload
- Resource management improvements

### 3. Font Loading Optimization

- Added `font-display: swap` for better performance
- Implemented fallback font system
- Improved font stack with local fallbacks

### 4. Development Experience

- Fixed WebSocket HMR connectivity
- Improved build performance with chunk splitting
- Added development optimizations in Vite config

## Rate Limiting Implementation Details

### Debouncing Strategy

```typescript
// Event handlers with debouncing
private handleWindowFocus = debounce(this.onWindowFocus.bind(this), 1000);
private handleWindowBlur = debounce(this.onWindowBlur.bind(this), 1000);
private handleVisibilityChange = debounce(this.onVisibilityChange.bind(this), 1000);
```

### Status Change Limits

- **Maximum**: 6 status changes per minute
- **Minimum Interval**: 5 seconds between changes
- **Heartbeat**: 10 seconds (reduced from 3 seconds)
- **Debounce**: 1-3 seconds on events

### Smart Throttling

- Non-throttled: Initial start, tracker stop, page unload
- Throttled: Focus/blur, visibility changes, heartbeats
- History tracking: Cleans up entries older than 1 minute

## Results

### Before Fixes

- 429 errors every few seconds
- Rate limit delays up to 300+ seconds
- Multiple React prop warnings
- Font loading 404 errors
- WebSocket connection failures

### After Fixes

- Rate limiting prevents 429 errors
- Clean console with no warnings
- Fonts load successfully
- Stable WebSocket connections
- Optimized performance

## Monitoring

The system now includes:

- Status change rate monitoring
- Safe logging to prevent console spam
- Performance helpers for optimization
- Memory leak prevention
- Automatic cleanup mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Rate Limiting**: Watch for any remaining 429 errors
2. **Font Performance**: Consider local font hosting if CDN issues persist
3. **React Router**: Plan for v7 migration when stable
4. **Performance**: Monitor API call patterns in production

## Files Modified

1. `src/index.css` - Fixed font URLs and added fallbacks
2. `src/lib/enhanced-realtime-tracker.ts` - Added comprehensive rate limiting
3. `vite.config.ts` - Fixed WebSocket and HMR configuration
4. `src/lib/react-fixes.ts` - Created utility for React optimizations
5. Multiple component files - Fixed `jsx` and `fetchPriority` props

All fixes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving performance and eliminating console errors.
