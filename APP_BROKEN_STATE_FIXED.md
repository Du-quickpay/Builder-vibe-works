# ‚úÖ App Broken State - FIXED

## Problem Summary

**Error**: `Syntax Error` in `telegram-callback-service-enhanced.ts` at line 272

```
x Expression expected
private switchApiEndpoint() {
```

The app was completely broken and wouldn't compile due to a syntax error.

## Root Cause

During previous edits to fix the "Failed to fetch" error, an extra closing brace was accidentally introduced in the `telegram-callback-service-enhanced.ts` file around line 267:

```typescript
    }
  }
  }  // ‚Üê This extra closing brace broke the syntax

  /**
   * Switch to next API endpoint
   */
  private switchApiEndpoint() {  // ‚Üê Error occurred here
```

This caused the TypeScript compiler to expect an expression instead of a method declaration.

## Fix Applied

1. **Replaced Broken File**: Overwrote the corrupted `telegram-callback-service-enhanced.ts` with the working version that includes:

   - Fixed syntax (no extra braces)
   - Smart network connectivity handling
